There once was a man named Bob. Bob loved to go to the grocery store everyday and look at all the food they offered. He loved looking at the dairy section, frozen sections, and canned foods. However, his favorite section was the fruits and vegetables until one day. It was the day that all of the fruits and vegetables were rotten. Bob could not believe it, and out of frustration, he knocked all of the fresh produce off the shelves.
Angrily, bob screamed for the manager; he was not going to allow this atrocity to affect another helpless person in need of artisan kale. He scoured the store flipping tables and toppling shelves trying to bring out the manager so that he could complain. Just then, one of the employees informed him that the manager was actually away on holiday and that they were maintaining the store by themselves. They said "We have to do all of the work. So... pretty much the same as when he was here actually..." Bob was astounded by this profound statement regarding the effect of the current socioeconomic standing in society, but he wasn't giving up.Bob suddently remembers that the boss of the grocery store was the school bus driver that he said "hi" all the time when he was in high school. He takes his phone outand calls his old buddy about the food issues. The boss is very mad and tell Bob he can be the new manager if he wants to. At the end, Bob gets a new job he likes and the foods in the grocery store have been taken good care.
From then on, Bob was the best grocer store manager in the world. Remembering the tragedy of the rotten fruits and vegetables he committed himself to never letting it happen again. While employees may remember Bob as a strict boss, Bob will always be the mananger who never let a single piece of fruit, or vegetables, go rotten so that no one would have to have such a horrific experience again.
