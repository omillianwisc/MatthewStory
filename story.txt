There once was a man named Bob. Bob loved to go to the grocery store everyday and look at all the food they offered. He loved looking at the dairy section, frozen sections, and canned foods. However, his favorite section was the fruits and vegetables until one day. It was the day that all of the fruits and vegetables were rotten. Bob could not believe it, and out of frustration, he knocked all of the fresh produce off the shelves.
